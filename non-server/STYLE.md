# Coding style guide

### PHP

- Indentation by tabs
- Brackets on their own line
- Omit brackets for single statement blocks
- All strings use single-quotes
- Only database queries use double-quotes!
- Database queries can be arranged on multiple lines for clarity
- Always use Db::escape when inserting variables into queries, use this function abundantly!

### JS

- Begin bracket appears immediately after the statement (one space)
- End brackets have their own line
- Brackets are never omitted
