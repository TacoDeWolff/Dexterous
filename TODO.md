* Custom 404 on production works but needs better error handling overall!!!
* Upload image in popup
* Assets: be able to delete directory
* Assets insert image: scroll to top when going to properties
* (?) Markdown page preview
* In Settings, put option to select Favicon image from asset
* Create Header Image module.
* In Header image module, put option to select asset for a Header image
    which is used in place of the default \<h1\> header

Later:
* Image size preview with squares on the corners in the Insert Image popup
* Multiple languages for admin interface
* (?) Page revisions
* (?) Difference between saving a page and publishing
* Expand sitemap (modify date, priority)
