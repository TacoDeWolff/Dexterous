# Coding style guide

## PHP

- Indentation by tabs
- Brackets on their own line
- Omit brackets for single statement blocks
- All strings use single-quotes
- Only database queries use double-quotes!
- Database queries can be arranged on multiple lines for clarity

## JS

- Begin bracket appears immediately after the statement (one space)
- End brackets has its own line
- Brackets are never omitted
