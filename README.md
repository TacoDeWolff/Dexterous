Dexterous
=========

Small but feature-rich CMS for small and medium sized websites and is meant for webdevelopers in need of a framework to deliver websites to their clients. The software focusses on speed overall and usability for the client. It tries to follow modern web methods (mobile support, typography, HTML5) and have a high-rating on PageSpeed.

Pro's
- Fast (due to no redirects, minifying, browser caching, server caching)
- Modular (adding themes and modules is easy and site is portable due to all data being stored in one folder (incl. database))
- Useful (intuitive admin panel for clients)

Cons:
- Not suited for blogs, forums or large sites (underdeveloped and software is build for speed not scalability)
